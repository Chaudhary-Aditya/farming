    <h2>Introduction to Organic Paddy Farming in India</h2>
    <p>Paddy plant is an annual warm-season grass having flat leaves, round culms, and terminal panicles. Paddy is the worldâ€™s most important food crop and dietary staple, ahead of bananas, wheat, and corn. Paddy is the main crop that receives the maximum quantity of pesticides (17 to 18%) and fertilizers (40%), and these practices pose major challenges in organic rice farming for pest and nutrient management. Paddy is the name of the crop, and rice are the grains obtained from Paddy. Rice is obtained from Paddy by removing the husk from Paddy. When Paddy grains are milled, rice is obtained.</p>

    <h2>A Step by Step Guide to Organic Paddy Farming</h2>
    <h3>Guide to Organic Paddy Farming</h3>
    <h3>Paddy Distribution in India</h3>
    <p>The main important rice-growing states in India are Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Haryana, Assam, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, etc.</p>

    <h3>Several Types of Rice Varieties</h3>
    <p>Several types of rice varieties are consumed in our country including Basmati, Red, Jasmine, Parboiled, White, Brown, and Sticky Rice. Of these, White and Basmati Rice are the ones that are most favored in the country. Paddy is a flexible crop and can be cultivated in a variety of climates, be it plains or mountains, and hence it can be grown as a Kharif crop or as a Rabi crop. The primary season is Kharif, where maximum rice sowing occurs from June to October, and for Rabi, the sowing time is November to February. The harvesting occurs in November-December for Kharif and March-June for Rabi. The states that cultivate rice for the Rabi season are Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Assam, West Bengal, etc.</p>

    <h3>Selection of Seeds for Organic Paddy Farming</h3>
    <p>To achieve better crop yield in the cultivation of Paddy, using quality seeds is an important factor. Proper care must be taken in choosing seeds of the best quality. The seeds planned for sowing must satisfy the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The seed must be clean and free from obvious mixtures of other seeds.</li>
        <li>It must be mature, well developed, and plump in size.</li>
        <li>The seed must be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage.</li>
        <li>It must have a high germinating capacity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Organic Soil Preparation for Paddy Farming</h3>
    <p>In Paddy cultivation, it is always good to study the nature, type, and nutrient content of the soil before adding nutrients. This can be done by having soil samples tested in a soil-testing laboratory. Paddy needs to retain water well; preferably, soil should include around 50% clay content. Soil underlain with an impervious hardpan or clay-pan helps to retain water. Topsoil must be ideally 18 to 23 cm deep. Manure can be applied based on the potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus content of the soil. The yield will be high when the pH level of the soil is between 5 and 6.5. If the pH level of the soil is below 5 or above 9, the yield will be poor. Alluvial soil, clayey, and sandy clay soils are best suited for Paddy cultivation.</p>

    <h3>Soil Fertility Management in Organic Paddy Farming</h3>
    <p>In organic Paddy cultivation, the application of chemical fertilizer is banned; it is suggested that growers select natural fertile land for cultivation. This early selection provides an advantage in maintaining quality and quantity. Growers must understand proper soil maintenance and management for sustainable production of organic Paddy. The following are references for soil fertility management:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No burning of remaining straws and tillers, or any other organic materials in the rice field. This will cause losses of beneficial microorganisms and organic matter.</li>
        <li>Growers may apply organic matter into the rice field for soil improvement frequently.</li>
        <li>Increase organic matter in soil by growing leguminous crops.</li>
        <li>The rice field should not be left idle after harvesting and before planting rice. The area must be covered with leguminous crops and others, such as Cowpea, Jack bean, or Sword bean, Indian hemp, and Sesbania ristrata.</li>
        <li>Soil analysis must be done yearly. Adjust the soil pH level to 5.5-6.5. In the case of high acidic soil, it is suggested to use marl or wood ash.</li>
        <li>The atmosphere contains around 78% nitrogen. In Paddy cultivation, some of the microbes that are usually used include Phosphobacteria, Azotobacter, and Azospirillum. They decrease the cost of chemical fertilizers and increase yield and soil fertility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Plant Growth Regulators</h3>
    <p>Panchagavya and Amirthakaraisal are used as growth regulators. For coarse varieties, one spray of 3% Panchagavya must be given in the booting and tillering stage. For fine varieties, one spray of 3% Panchagavya should be given in the booting stage. Around 1,250 liters of Amirthakaraisal must be mixed with irrigation water for a one-hectare crop. When used as a spray, 25 liters are essential. This gives good yield and improves soil fertility.</p>

    <h3>Spacing Requirements in Organic Paddy Farming</h3>
    <p>For normal sown crops, the suggested spacing between rows is 20 to 22.5 cm. When sowing is delayed, a closer spacing of 15-18 cm must be adopted.</p>

    <h3>Seed Rate and Seed Treatment in Organic Paddy Farming</h3>
    <p>For one acre of land, 8 kg of seeds are sufficient for planting. Seed treatment helps to increase the germination potential, vigor, and resistance to diseases and pests. Below are the different methods of Paddy seed treatment:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Paddy seed treatment with Cow dung and Cow urine:</strong> Take 1 liter of Cow urine and mix it with 4 liters of water, and soak seeds overnight. Mix Cow dung with 1 kg of seeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Paddy seed treatment with Panchagavya:</strong> Mix 1 liter of Panchagavya with 4 liters of water, and soak seeds overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Paddy seed treatment with Khadira and Strychnos:</strong> For 1 kg of seeds, 2 kg of Khadira bark should be boiled in water. The seeds can be soaked overnight in the cooled solution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Paddy Weeding and Irrigation</h3>
    <p>In the first 20-30 days after sowing, there is a heavy infestation of weeds. The seedlings become weak due to weeds taking moisture and nutrients. Mechanical weeding and weeding by hand should be done. In rice cultivation, 5-6 waterings are sufficient for good crop growth.</p>

    <h3>Paddy Harvesting</h3>
    <p>In harvesting, the grains must be matured and dried well. Harvesting should be done when around 85% of the grains turn golden. Harvesting must be done in a 7-10 day interval for high quality. For harvesting, sickles can be used. If harvesting is delayed, then shattering losses will occur.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Organic farming is a sustainable way of agriculture that improves the quality of soil, air, and water. It enhances the environment and provides healthy food while ensuring better profitability for farmers.</p>
